NHA Admin Application
====================================
Micro frontend for managing NHA operations

### Technology stack
- React
- Typescript
- Chakra UI
- Spring Boot
- Spring Cloud Gateway
- JDK 11
- Kotlin
- Docker

The application is split into 2 modules. The frontend react application and spring boot backend

### Development Setup for Frontend
- Install [GIT](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).
- Install [Node Version Manager (NVM)](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating) to setup and manage different versions of NVM.
- Install [LTS version of Node](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#long-term-support) via NVM.
- Install an IDE of your choice. We recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) for frontend development

### Available Scripts

The frontend module is located at `src/main/frontend`. The same location should be used to load the project in IDE 

In the project directory, you can run the following commands in the terminal:

#### `npm install`

Installs all the required dependencies for the project

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br /> Open
[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles
React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.

### Development Setup for Backend
- Install [SDKMAN](https://sdkman.io/install) to setup and manage different versions of JDK.
  [AdoptOpenJDK](https://sdkman.io/jdks#AdoptOpenJDK) is recommended JDK implementation for installation
- Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/). Different OS have different installation guides.
- Install [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/). Different OS have different installation guides.
- Install an IDE of your choice. At the time of writing, [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download)
  is the only IDE with comprehensive support for kotlin

### Building the backend application
[Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) is used as a build tool for building the application. The project has maven wrapper
for **Linux** and **Windows** environments and scripts to execute the build respectively.
Maven installation is not required

For **Linux** machines, use the following command to build the application.
- `cd` into the project directory
- `./mvnw clean verify` command to build the application

For **Windows** machines, use the following command to build the application.
- `cd` into the project directory
- `./mvnw.cmd clean verify` command to build the application

The maven command will also copy over artifacts generated by the frontend build under `src/main/frontend/build` folder to `public`
folder under `target/classes/public` folder. 

If there are changes in the frontend code, rebuild the frontend react app and execute the following maven command from the terminal or
from maven tool window if using IntelliJ IDE  

`mvn resources:resources`

To the run the application locally, set the following environment variable in IDE

`SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=development`
